# Sporting 2gether

Sporting 2gether is a social media website focused on sports activities, known as "events." Users will be able to join events created by other users, so they can gather and do things like basketball games or something.

From Robert: I still have minimal knowledge of how to work GIT and as such I may not be able to answer all questions. I'm still figuring this out myself. I'm working on instructions for getting stuff flowing which will be posted on Facebook, so stay tuned.
