# Sporting 2gether

Sporting 2gether is a social media website focused on sports activities, known as "events." Users will be able to join events created by other users, so they can gather and do things like basketball games or something.

For contributors: Please do not commit changes directly to the master branch. Instead, create a new branch using your last name. At the end of the project, we'll merge the branches together to create the final product.

From Robert: I still have minimal knowledge of how to work GIT and as such I may not be able to answer all questions. I'm still figuring this out myself. I'm working on instructions for getting stuff flowing which will be posted on Facebook, so stay tuned.

From Robert: I would like to apologize for the sudden new directory. I'm not sure how to remove it. Git is just a pain to use. Please ignore it. Thank you.

To set up the database properly, once you've pulled the project, use:
python manage.py makemigrations sporting2gether
python manage.py migrate
